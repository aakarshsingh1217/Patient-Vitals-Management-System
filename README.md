# Patient-Vitals-Management-System
- C++ patient management system that records and monitors patient vitals (heart rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, and brain activity) to report alerts for concerning results based on specific diseases such as Amogus sus, E Rush, Nocap Syndrome, and Advanced Ticctocc Brain Damage.
- Uses design patterns (Adapter, Composite, Observer, and Strategy) to solve complex design problems, ensuring efficient and maintainable code structure.
- Utilizes object-oriented programming principles to modify and expand the system, with modern C++ memory management and safe, robust C++ code for reliable performance.
